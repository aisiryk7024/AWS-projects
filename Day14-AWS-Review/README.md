# AWS Services Recap & GitHub Workflow Review

This folder documents my review of key AWS services:
- IAM: Identity and access management
- S3: Object storage basics
- EC2: Virtual server configurations
- VPC: Networking components including subnets, route tables, and security groups

It also demonstrates basic GitHub workflows such as branching, pull requests, and merging.
